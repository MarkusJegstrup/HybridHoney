# HybridHoney

The `HybridHoney` honeypot employs GPT-4o-mini to simulate an SSH honeypot. 
The tool was created as part of a master thesis, conducted by 3 students from DTU compute.

## Features

`HybridHoney` is developed in Python and employs GPT-4o-mini from Open AI. Its key features include:
1. Dynamic file system and file contents generated by LLM
2. Personality promt for LLM in-context-learning
3. Session logging and session history
4. File download for further inspection upon wget, curl and tftp
5. Emulated sudo access
6. Improved formatting and terminal interface actions

## Installation and usage
Can either be run locally or on a virtual machine, 
certain features that has to do with permissions, user creation only works by setting it with setup script.

For local deployment:
```bash
~$ # Install requirements
~$ pip install -r requirements.txt
~$
~$ # Create env file
~$ cp env_TEMPLATE .env
~$ # Edit the file to contain you API key: OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
~$ vim .env
```
Run the program:
```
~$ python3 LinuxSSHbot.py 
```
For Virtual deployment:    
Create .env file and add your API key.    
run the setup.sh script with sudo privileges: "sudo ./setup.sh".    
Access the honeypot through SSH connection:      
ssh user@`<your-IP-address>`
